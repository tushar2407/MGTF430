# Asset Managment Project
This a project developed by a team of 4 as part of the `MGTF 430` coursework at `UCSD`.

## About the project
In this project, our aim is to use CRSP cross-sectional dataset and build ML models to predict returns on the time-series data of a stock. 
Additionally, we are using cross-sectional data to reduce the number of features required for return predictions in the future. This is our attempt at buidling quantitative strategies for maximising returns. 

In this project, we will be testing our strategies using `Back-tests`.
